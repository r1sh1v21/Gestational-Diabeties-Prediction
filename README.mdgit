The objective of this project is to utilize the XGBoost algorithm in machine learning to construct a predictive model for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk assessment in pregnant women. By leveraging clinical and demographic data, the model aims to accurately identify individuals at a higher risk of developing GDM, enabling early intervention and personalized care strategies. The ultimate goal is to enhance maternal and fetal health outcomes by improving the efficiency of GDM detection and management protocols.
